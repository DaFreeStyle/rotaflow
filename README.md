# WELCOME TO THE ROTAFLOW PROJECT
# Project Overview
This group project is created and by the Freesytle Squad: 
Felipe Hernandez, Kitty Pelerin, and Rastko Sassic of GA. 
The name of our App is RotaFlow.  Rota is Latin for wheel or a 
form of rotation or roster call, an overview, list of duties, or 
in this case, wish items. RotaFlow is a fun, user-friendly, 
organization app, which facilitates your wishes easier.

The application allows users to search products online and add 
those products to their list of wished products.

RotaFlow have two types of users, registered and guest users.
Registered users make and keep a profile, and they can save 
searched products to that profile. On the other hand, 
guest users can search for wish lists of family members, 
friends, or people they know so that they can get those 
products for them.

#Priority Matrix
![MATRIX](https://git.generalassemb.ly/youngmaid/freestyle-rotaflow/blob/master/images/time-matrix.jpg)

High: The high priority quadrum involves the MVC/CRUD Structure. One of 
the biggest challenges are fetching an API database info for the app.  
One other challenge are the fields categoty forms to filter out the data.

Medium: Second, but also a high priority are User authentication for 
the log in forms building a functional table and routes as well as 
links for react.

Low: Low, but still important and integral to workflow and group 
dynamics are project issues, and describing each step of this project. 
In addition, the delegation and responsibilities of each member of the 
group as well as syncing, committing and updating files for github.

The last stages of this matrix are responsive layout, and CSS styles.

##MVP 
- Generate express/node servers as well as react. 
- Build Controllers, Routes, and Models.
- API Database/AXIOS.

##POST-MVP
- Bootstrap/Responsive Web Layout
- Deployment on Heroku

#CHALLENGES
    Fetching the API's and utilizing the keys were very difficult. 
    Parsing the data is thru search forms will also be a challenging
    feat. User Authentication will be the next challenge.
#HAPPY MOMENTS
    Today, there was some development in fetching the API database for 
    Ebay. Parsing the data will be another difficult issue.

#PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Tasks
